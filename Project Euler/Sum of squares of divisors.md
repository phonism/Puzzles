#**Sum of squares of divisors*

###**Description**

Let sigma2(n) represent the sum of the squares of the divisors of n. 
Let SIGMA2(n) represent the summatory function of sigma2, that is SIGMA2
(n) = sigma\{sigma2(i)\} for i = 1 to n. The first 6 values of SIGMA2 are: 
1, 6, 16, 37, 63 and 113. Now find SIGMA2(10^15) modulo 10^9.

##**Solution**
